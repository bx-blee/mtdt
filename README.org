* Overview
MTDT (Mail Templating, Distribution and Tracking) is part of Blee. Blee (ByStar Libre-Halaal Emacs Environment)
serves as the usage environment of BISOS (ByStar Internet Services OS). BISOS forms the foundation of the
"Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital Ecosystem." ByStar is rooted in the model of proper governance of polyexistentials
which rejects the Western Intelectual Propoerty Rights (IPR) regime. For a comprehensive description, please refer
to the book:  'The Nature of Polyexistentials' -- https://github.com/bxplpc/120033.

MTDT is developed in elisp with COMEEGA (Collaborative Org-Mode Enhanced Emacs Generalized Authorship). Think of
COMEEGA as inverse of literate programming. Please follow Blee-COMEEGA conventions when editing MTDT elisp files.

MTDT augments the Emacs email environment (Gnus) by providing templates for mailings and distributions. You can
think of MTDT as a Libre-Halaal Convivial equivalent of Constant Contact for Emacs.
MTDT allows you to create *Mailing Tempaltes* with content in 1) Plain Text, 2) Org-Msg, 3) LaTeX and 4) Plain Html.
The Mailing Templates can then be used to =Send= or =Distribute=  to =Recipients=.
=Recipients= can be derived from =Names= in address books such as =BBDB3=.

* Abstract -- Concepts and Terminoloy

Emacs has a very rich email environment. The scope of Emacs email environment is primarily that of sending,
receiving, processing, searching, archiving and integration with address books, org-mode and other global
minor-modes. Mail Templating, Distribution and Tracking (MTDT) are currently not well supported. In the context of
/Email Marketting/, in the proprietary world, things like /SendGrid/ and /Constant Contact/ have appeared on the
scene. Such capabilities are best supported when they are integrated with the MUA. Hence, it does make sense to
build much MTDT capabilities inside of emacs. Mass email distribution, email commencing and email templating have
much overlap.

To talk about email in detail and precisely we need a rich and explicit vocabulary to refer to well defined
concepts and abstractions. We use four sources for our vocabulary and concepts. 1) X.400 Specifications, 2)
Internet Email RFCs Specifications, 3) Gnus Manuals, 4) Our own extenstions (see below).

** MARMEE -- Multi-Account Resident Mail Exchange Environment

MTDT exists on top of MARMEE and uses MARMEE facilities for sending and receiving email.
See https://github.com/bisos-pip/marmee for details.

** A Mailing

A Mailing-File is a partial or complete email that can be used to [[Compose]] a message. A /Mailing-File/ can reside
anywhere on the file system. A Mailing-File can become part of MTDT (internalized in MTDTD) by being /Derived/.

A <<Derived-Mailing>> always maps to a /Mailing-File/. A Derived-Mailing can then be used for [[Origination]].
There are four types of Mailing-Files, used for 4 different purposes.:


1) *CommenceMailing*.  No To Line, Incompleete Content,  From, Subject and Signature.
2) *TemplateMailing*. To Line + Incomplete Content, From, Subject and Signature.
3) *DistributionMailing*. No To Line, Complete Content, From and Subject.
4) *MuaStencilMailing*. MUA uses in Reply and Forward.


(1), (2) and (3) are used for Composition. (4) is used for Replys and Forwards.

A *Mailing* can be any of (1), (2), (3) or (4).

A *Compose-Mailing* can be any of (1), (2) or (3).

** Compose -- Native-Compose  and External-Compose

<<Compose>> is the act of starting to write a /new/ email. Replying and Forwarding are distinct and different from
Composing. Composition can be from scratch or through a [[Derived Mailing]].

MTDT currently supports 4 different /Compose-Frameworks/ for composing.
These are 1) Plain Text, 2) Org-Msg, 3) LaTeX and 4) Html.

Mailings with  /Compose-Frameworks/ of (1) and (2) are always invoked as Native-Compose.

Mailings with  /Compose-Frameworks/ of (3) and (4)can be invoked as Native-Compose or External-Compose.
Native-Compose of (3) and (4) allow for editing of headers but not body.
External-Compose of (3) and (4) allow for editing of body and headers.

** Origination  -- Union of Compose, Reply or Forward

<<Origination>> is the act of starting a Compose, Reply or Forward.

** Mailing Invocation Functions

A Mailing-Invocation is the act of invoking a relevant function to a [[Derived-Mailing]].

A Mailing-Invocation is labled with Mailing-Inv-

For CommenceMailing and TemplateMailing and DistributionMailing

- Mailing-Inv-Compose (auto determination of Mailing-Inv-Native-Compose or Mailing-Inv-External-Compose)
- Mailing-Inv-Native-Compose
- Mailing-Inv-External-Compose (Copies the LaTeX environment)

With Selected-Recipients, for CommenceMailing and TemplateMailing and DistributionMailing

- Mailing-Inv-Dist-Compose
- Mailing-Inv-Dist-Native-Compose
- Mailing-Inv-Dist-External-Compose (Copies the LaTeX environment)

With Selected-Recipients, for DistributionMailing

- Mailing-Inv-Dist-Send

With Selected-Recipients-Forms-File, for DistributionMailing

- Mailing-Inv-Dist-Send
- Mailing-Inv-Dist-Compose
- Mailing-Inv-Dist-Dispatch  (Based on DispatchControl, either Mailing-Inv-Dist-Send or Mailing-Inv-Dist-Compose )

** Related Mailing Buffers and Directories

The following Mailing Bufers are used.

- Mailing-Buffer  --- That of Mailing-File
- Compose-Buffer  --- The unsent-buffer used for Native or External Composition
- unsent-buffer   --- Traditional buffer used by emacs
- sent-buffer     --- After sending

* Abstract -- Layering

Implemetation of MTDT is layered. Each layer is implemented as an Emacs package. See  [[MTDT-Layering]] for details.

** MTDT-Mailings Layer

This is an overview of <<MTDT-Mailings Layer>>.

The primary concept of MTDT-Mailings  is the *X-Mailing-Name File*. This is a file that contains a complete or
a partial email. Both its headers and its body can then be customized by MTDT facilities.
*X-Mailing-Name File* s contain some special headers that direct and customize operations of MTDT facilities.
These MTDT Headers include:

- *X-Mailing-Name:* is a string that is used to internalize and identify the *X-Mailing-Name File* to
  MTDT. There is two-way and one-to-one mapping between these two. The *Derive* family of of functions of
  MTDT are used create this mapping. Once *Derived*, the *X-Mailing-Name File* can be accessed through its
  *X-Mailing-Name:*. *X-Mailing-Name File* can be anywhere in the file system and are not part of MTDT untill
  they are *Derived*.

- *X-ComposeFwrk:* specifies the framework (mode) to be used for handling the body of an *X-Mailing-Name File*.
  When the body of the message is in org-mode, *OrgMsg* mode is used. Valid values of
  1) Plain Text, 2) Org-Msg, 3) LaTeX and 4) Plain Html.
  See  [[https://github.com/bx-blee/mtdt-mailing][mailing]] 's Blee-Panel for details.

- *X-MailingParams:* specifies named parameters for use by MTDT.

- *X-MailingParams: :extSrcBase <dirPathOrNil>* specifies as to whether or not the body of the message is to be
  considered *External* or *Native*. *External* only applies to *X-ComposeFwrk:* Org-Msg, LaTeX. For a
  *X-Mailing-Name File* whose body was produced using external facilities such as LaTeX (lcntProc.sh), when
  *X-MailingParams: :extSrcBase <dirPath>* is set, when *sendingEnvironment* is created, the entire directory of
  *X-Mailing-Name File* is copied to the *sendingEnvironment* environemnt.

 - *X-MTDT-Customize:* specifies a path to an elisp file, or a function that can run in the *sendingEnvironment*
   to customize both headers and body of the outgoing message.

See  [[https://github.com/bx-blee/mtdt-mailing][mailing]] 's Blee-Panel for details.

*X-Mailing-Name File* can be used for different purposes, including as a:

1) *CommenceMailing*. 2) *TemplateMailing*. 3) *DistributionMailing*. 4) *MuaStencilMailing*.

The above types each have a *Selected* instance.

When a *Selected* mailing is *Sent* it first becomes an *OutGoingMessage*.

See  [[https://github.com/bx-blee/mtdt-mailing][mailing]] 's Blee-Panel for details.

** MTDT-Distributions Layer

This is an overview of <<MTDT-Distributions Layer>> which builds on the  [[MTDT-Mailings Layer]].

The primary concept of MTDT-Distributions  is the elisp abstraction of *Recipients*.
*Recipients* apply to a single *OutGoingMessage*. A list of *Recipients* constitutes a
*RecipientsList*. A *Distribution* is the exercising of  a *RecipientsList* to an *OutGoingMessagesList*
where each *Recipients* is applied to each *OutGoingMessage*.

When a *RecipientsList* is selected it comes the *SelectedRecipientsList*.

** MTDT-Names Layer

This is an overview of <<MTDT-Names Layer>> which builds on the [[MTDT-Distributions Layer]] and [[MTDT-Mailings Layer]].

The primary concept of MTDT-Names is the elisp abstraction of  *Name* and *Names*.
A *Name* maps to a single entry in the *AddressBook* say ~bbdb~. *Names* can be converted to *RecipientsList*.

** MTDT-Share Layer

This is an overview of <<MTD-Share Layer>> which builds on the
 [[MTDT-Names Laye]]r  and [[MTDT-Distributions Layer]] and [[MTDT-Mailings Layer]].

Based on a *SelectedRecipientsList* MTDT facilities can provide for *Sharing*
when using Dire-mode or through interfacing with the browser.

** MTDT-Tracking Layer

This is an overview of <<MTD-Tracking Layer>> which builds on the [[MTD-Share Layer]] and
 [[MTDT-Names Laye]]r  and [[MTDT-Distributions Layer]] and [[MTDT-Mailings Layer]].

Sending and distributions can be tracked based on the information provided by logs of injection, submission
and Non-Delivery-Reports and Delivery-Reports and Receipt-Notification.

All of that tracking can be arranged per *OutGoingMessage*.

See MARMEE for details.


* MTDT Installation

As with all blee packages, blee-installation and straight-installation information is provided.
